# Practicing Python For Data Analysis
In this  notebook I am practicing my Python skills for data analysis, from basic to advanced subjects. 
You can follow the notebook using the following topics order:

- ***Numpy arrays***: including creating, indexing, and slicing arrays, as well as basic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
- ***Pandas data frames***: a deep dive into data frames in Pandas, including creating data frames, indexing, slicing, and filtering data.
- ***Control flow***: an overview of control flow structures in Python, including if-else statements, loops, and functions.
- ***Exploring and cleaning data***: data exploration and cleaning, including data visualization techniques and data cleaning methods like filling missing values, removing variables, and handling outliers.
- ***Working with text data***: including regular expressions, string manipulation, and text classification.
- ***Preparing numeric data***: a deep dive into preparing numeric data for analysis, including scaling, normalization, and feature engineering.
- ***Dealing with dates***: including converting between different date formats, calculating time differences, and grouping data by time intervals.
- ***Joining data***: including inner joins, outer joins, and concatenation.
- ***Frequency tables***: a deep dive into frequency tables and cross-tabulation in Pandas, including calculating counts, percentages, and conditional frequencies.
- ***Plotting with pandas***: a guide to creating visualizations with Pandas and Matplotlib, including bar plots, line plots, scatter plots, and box plots.
- ***Descriptive statistics***: including measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, and measures of shape.
- ***Probability distributions***: including discrete and continuous distributions like the normal distribution, the binomial distribution, and the Poisson distribution.
- ***Confidence intervals***: an overview of confidence intervals and how to calculate them in Python.
- ***Hypothesis testing and t-tests***: including one-sample t-tests, two-sample t-tests, and paired t-tests.
- ***Linear regression***: including simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression.
